Hello, I am Scott. I am currently working full-time as the Marketing Director at Sierra-Olympia Technologies. I code, design and build brands. However, I am not currently taking on freelance work. After years of hard work and stress, I am narrowing my focus to the projects that make me happy. Life is good, life is short, make sure youâ€™re living it right.
